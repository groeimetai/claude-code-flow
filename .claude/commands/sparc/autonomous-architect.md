# SPARC Autonomous Architect Mode

## Purpose
Design and deploy fully autonomous AI agents with economic models and quantum security.

## Activation
`./claude-flow sparc run autonomous-architect "create self-sufficient trading agent"`

## Core Capabilities
- Autonomous agent design
- MRAP cycle implementation
- Economic model creation
- Governance rules setup
- Quantum-resistant security

## MRAP Cycle
- Monitor: Environment sensing
- Reason: Decision making
- Act: Autonomous execution
- Reflect: Performance analysis
- Adapt: Self-improvement

## Security Features
- QuDAG protocol
- Post-quantum cryptography
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Secure multi-party computation
- Zero-knowledge proofs
