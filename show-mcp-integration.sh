echo "1. With Swarms:"
echo "   ./claude-flow swarm \"Analyze my codebase with cognitive triangulation\""
echo "   ./claude-flow swarm \"Create neural swarm for optimization\""
echo "   ./claude-flow swarm \"Deploy autonomous agents for testing\""
echo ""
echo "2. With SPARC modes:"
echo "   ./claude-flow sparc run cognitive-analyst \"Analyze authentication system\""
echo "   ./claude-flow sparc run graph-architect \"Build API knowledge graph\""
echo ""
echo "3. Test the integration:"
echo "   node test-simple-tools.js"
echo "   node test-mcp-integration.js"
echo ""
echo "‚ú® The MCP tools are now seamlessly integrated with claude-flow!"
echo "   They work with all existing swarm strategies and can be combined"
echo "   with other claude-flow features like memory, batch execution, etc."
